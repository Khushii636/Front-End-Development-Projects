## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khushii636/Front-End-Development-Projects/To-Do_List.git
cd to-do-list-app
```

2. **Open the project**

```bash
# You can simply open index.html in your browser
```

## 🧠 How It Works

- Tasks are stored as objects:
  ```js
  { text: "Buy groceries", completed: false }
  ```

- The app uses:
  - `localStorage` to persist tasks
  - JavaScript event listeners for interactivity
  - `renderTasks()` to sync UI with stored data

---

## ✨ Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

- Add due dates and time reminders
- Enable drag-and-drop sorting
- Add theme toggler (light/dark)
- Use backend (Firebase or Supabase) for login & cloud sync
